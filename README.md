# **Reproducibility of AIRR_sequencing tools**

## **About the project**

This study evaluates the reproducibility of AIRR-seq bioinformatics tools by generating synthetic replicates through in-silico shuffling of sequencing reads. We focus on two tools, MiXCR and TRUST4, assessing their performance in clonotype identification and consistency of results across computational replicates. Synthetic replicates, created by shuffling the reads of fastq files, provide a controlled environment to test the reproducibility of bioinformatics tools, reducing the experimental variations that typically affect sequencing outputs. Using a dataset comprising publicly available TCR repertoires we generated 10 synthetic replicates for each sample and analyzed them using MiXCR and TRUST4.
